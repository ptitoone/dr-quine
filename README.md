# dr-quine
A School 42 Cybersecurity project

This project invites you to confront the principle of self-reproduction and the problems
that derive from it. It is a perfect introduction to more complex projects, particularly
malware projects.

# Goal

Write a few self-replicating programs named Collen, Grace and Sully, written in **C**, **ASM** and one other language of choice. **Python** was chosen as bonus.

## Skills gained

Stack manipulation and macros in **ASM**, new formatting tricks and knowledge about **Quine** programs.
